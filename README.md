## Notes

- These scripts are designed for **Ubuntu**; they are not supported on **Mac** and **Windows**
- For Go versions managed by `install_go_with_command.sh`, ensure `$HOME/go/bin` is included in your `PATH`
- Always verify installation with `go version` after setup
- When switching Go versions using `gomvm switch`, the selected version persists across shell sessions and `.bashrc` reloads
- For general Go installation guidance, refer to the [official Go documentation](https://go.dev/doc/install)

## Prerequisite

Please ddd the following Go environment configuration to your `~/.bashrc` file for gomvm to work properly.

The following functions are enabled by the configulation:

- Version persistence across shell sessions
- Automatic version selection based on your saved preferences
- Optional latest version checking (disabled by default)

```bash
# Go environment setup - conditional based on gomvm presence
if command -v gomvm &> /dev/null || [ -f "$HOME/.config/gomvm/config" ]; then
  # gomvm exists - use advanced version management
  
  # Check for persisted version selection
  GO_SELECTED_VERSION_FILE="$HOME/.go_selected_version"
  if [ -f "$GO_SELECTED_VERSION_FILE" ] && [ -s "$GO_SELECTED_VERSION_FILE" ]; then
    GO_VERSION=$(cat "$GO_SELECTED_VERSION_FILE")
    if [ -x "$HOME/go/bin/go$GO_VERSION" ]; then
      # Set GOROOT for the selected version
      export GOROOT=$("$HOME/go/bin/go$GO_VERSION" env GOROOT)
      # Update PATH (prioritize selected version)
      export PATH="$GOROOT/bin:$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
    else
      # Default settings if selected version not found
      export PATH="/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
    fi
  else
    # Default settings if no version selection file
    export PATH="/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
  fi
  
  # Latest version check (disabled by default)
  # To enable automatic version checking, uncomment the source line below
  if [ -f "$HOME/.config/gomvm/config" ]; then
    source "$HOME/.config/gomvm/config"
    if [ -n "$GOMVM_SCRIPTS_DIR" ]; then
      INSTALL_DIR=$(dirname "$(dirname "$GOMVM_SCRIPTS_DIR")")
      SCRIPT_PATH="$INSTALL_DIR/check_latest_go.sh"
      if [ -f "$SCRIPT_PATH" ]; then
        # source "$SCRIPT_PATH"  # Uncomment this line to enable automatic version checking
        :  # No-op placeholder
      fi
    fi
  fi
else
  # gomvm not present - use standard Go settings only
  export PATH="/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH"
  export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
fi
```

## Installation

### Automatic Installation

The easiest way to set up go-multi-version-manager.

```bash
# Download and run the installer script
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7rikazhexde/go-multi-version-manager/main/gomvm-install.sh | bash

# Load updated PATH settings
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Manual Installation

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and set it up manually.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/7rikazhexde/go-multi-version-manager.git
cd go-multi-version-manager

# Set up gomvm
./gomvm setup

# Load updated PATH settings
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Automatic Uninstallation

To completely remove gomvm from your system, run the following command.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7rikazhexde/go-multi-version-manager/main/gomvm-uninstall.sh | bash
```

This uninstallation script performs the following actions.

- Removes the gomvm repository directory from your system
- Deletes the configuration directory (`~/.config/gomvm`)
- Removes the gomvm binary from `~/.local/bin`

> [!WARNING]
> The uninstallation process does not remove the following.
>
> - Go versions installed in `$HOME/go/bin` (installed via `gomvm install`)
> - Go versions installed in system directories (e.g., `/usr/local/go`)
>
> If you want to completely remove everything, you can manually delete the following.
>
> 1. Go versions in `$HOME/go/bin/`
> 2. The default Go installation in `/usr/local/go`

## Usage

### Basic Commands

After installation, you can use the following commands.

```bash
# List available Go versions
gomvm list

# Install a specific Go version
gomvm install 1.24.1

# List installed Go versions
gomvm installed

# Uninstall a specific Go version
gomvm uninstall 1.24.1
```

### Switching Go Versions

To switch between installed Go versions.

```bash
# Switch to Go 1.24.1
source gomvm switch 1.24.1
```

The `switch` command will:

1. Change the Go version for your current shell session
2. Save your version preference to make it persist across shell sessions
3. Ensure the selected version remains active even after reloading `.bashrc`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always use the `source` command with `switch` to make the changes take effect in your current shell.

If you wish to return to the system default Go version, you can either:

- Delete the saved preference: `rm $HOME/.go_selected_version`
- Then reload your shell: `source ~/.bashrc`

### Enabling Latest Version Check

The latest version check feature is disabled by default to avoid unnecessary network requests. To enable it:

1. Edit your `~/.bashrc` file
2. Find the line `# source "$SCRIPT_PATH"` in the gomvm configuration section
3. Uncomment it by removing the `#` character
4. Save the file and reload your `.bashrc`

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

Once enabled, this feature:

- Checks for the latest Go version at login
- Only checks once per 24 hours to avoid excessive network requests
- Suggests installation if the latest version isn't installed
- Can be forced to check using the `--force` option, ignoring the 24-hour rule

To manually check for the latest version:

```bash
source ~/path/to/go-multi-version-manager/check_latest_go.sh --force
```

## Scripts

### install_go_replace_default.sh

Installs the default version of Go in `/usr/local/go`, replacing any existing version.

Usage:

```bash
./install_go_replace_default.sh 1.23.2
```

The script will prompt you to confirm the deletion of `/usr/local/go` if it already exists, and then install the specified version.

### install_go_with_command.sh

Installs Go using the `go install` command, allowing multiple versions to be installed in `${HOME}/go/bin`.

Usage:

```bash
./install_go_with_command.sh 1.23.1
```

The script installs the specified version and places it in `${HOME}/go/bin/go<version>`.

### install_go_specific.sh

Installs a specific version of Go in `/usr/local/go<version>`. If the specified version is already installed, it will be skipped.

Usage:

```bash
./install_go_specific.sh 1.23.0
```

This script allows for multiple versions to be installed in separate directories.

### switch_go_version.sh

Switches to a specified Go version. Run this script with `source` to use the specified Go version in the current shell session and to save it as the default for future sessions. If the specified Go version is not installed, this script will automatically install it.

Usage:

```bash
source ./switch_go_version.sh 1.23.0
```

The script now saves your selected version to make it persist across shell sessions, so you don't need to switch every time you start a new shell or reload `.bashrc`.

### list_go_versions.sh

Fetches a list of available Go versions from the official download page.

Usage:

```bash
./list_go_versions.sh
```

This script retrieves all available versions from the [Go download page](https://go.dev/dl/) and displays them.

## Developer Options

### Setting Up Pre-commit Hook for Shell Scripts

To help maintain code quality, you can set up a `pre-commit` hook that automatically runs `shellcheck` on all shell scripts before each commit.

### Steps to Set Up Pre-commit Hook

1. Install `shellcheck`

   ```bash
   sudo apt install shellcheck
   ```

2. Add Execution Permission

   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/ci/create_pre-commit.sh
   ```

3. Run the Create Pre-commit Script

   ```bash
   ./scripts/ci/create_pre-commit.sh
   ```

This will create a `pre-commit` hook under `.git/hooks/` that will automatically check all `.sh` files in `scripts/ubuntu` before each commit.
To run the pre-commit hook manually, execute `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.
